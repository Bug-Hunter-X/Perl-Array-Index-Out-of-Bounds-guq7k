This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version with proper bounds checking.  The error typically results in either undefined behavior or a runtime exception, depending on the Perl version and context.
